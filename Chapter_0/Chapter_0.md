## WHAT IS PROGRAMMING?
**Computer programming is a medium for us to communicate with computers. Just like we use "Hindi" or "English" to communicate with each other, programming is a way for us to deliver our instruction to the computer**

## WHAT IS C?
**1. C is programming language.** 
**2. C is one of the oldest anad finest programming language.** 
**3. C was developed by Dennis Ritchie at AT&T's Bell Labs, USA in 1972.** 

## USES OF C

**C language is used to program a wide variety of systems. Some of the uses of C are as follows :**

1. Major parts of Windows, Linux and other operating systems are written in C.
2. C is used to write driver programs for devices like tablets, printers etc.
3. C language is used to program embedded systems where programs need to run faster in limited memory 
4. C is used to develop games, an area where latency is very important , i.e., the computer has to react quickly to user input.


## INSTALLATION 

**We will use VS Code as our code editor to write our code and install MinGW gcc compiler to compile our C program.**

**Compilation is the process of translating high-level source code written in programming language like C into machine code, which is the low-level code that a computer's CPU can excute directly. Machine code consists of binary instructions specific to a computer's architecture.**
