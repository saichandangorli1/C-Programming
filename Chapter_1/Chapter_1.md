# CHAPTER 1 : VARIABLES, CONSTANTS & KEYWORDS

## VARIABLES

A variable is a container which stores a 'value'.In kitchen, we have containers storing. Rice, Dal, Sugar etc. Similar to that. variables in C stores value of a constant.

**_Example:_**

```bash
a = 3; // a is assigned "3"
b = 4.7; // b is assigned "4.7"
c = 'A'; // c is assigned 'A'
```

## RULES FOR NAMING VARIABLES IN C

1.  First character must be an alphabet or underscore(\_).

2.  No commas, blanks are allowed.

3.  No special symbols other than (\_) allowed.

4.  Variables names are case sensitive

We must create meaningful variable names in our programs. This Enhances readability of our program.

## CONSTANTS

An entity whose value does not change is called as a constant.

A variable is an entity whose value can be changed.

## TYPES OF CONSTANTS

Primarily, there are three types of constants:

1. Integers Constants <span style="color:hotpink;">&rarr; 1,2,3,4</span>

2. Real Constants <span style="color:hotpink;">&rarr; 322.1,2.5,7.0</span>

3. Character Constants <span style="color:hotpink;">&rarr; 'a','$','@' (must be enclosed within single inverted commmas)</span>

<!-- Size of int : 4 bytes
Size of float : 4 bytes
Size of char : 1 bytes  -->

## KEYWORDS

Thes are reserved words, whose meaning is already known to the compiler. There are 32 keywords available in C.

| KEYWORDS | KEYWORDS |
| -------- | -------- |
| auto     | double   |
| struct   | long     |
| switch   | register |
| extern   | char     |
| float    | signed   |
| for      | short    |
| goto     | default  |
| int      | break    |
| case     | else     |
| typedef  | return   |
| enum     | union    |
| const    | unsigned |
| continue | void     |
| volatile | sizeof   |
| if       | do       |
| while    | static   |
